# Amazon Sales Analysis – Internship Project

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a data analysis internship. The objective is to analyze Amazon sales transaction data to uncover key business insights related to sales performance, order fulfillment, and customer demand patterns.

## Problem Description:
The provided dataset contains information about sales transactions on Amazon, including details such as order ID, date, status, fulfilment method, sales channel, product category, size, quantity, amount, shipping details, and more. The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data and extract actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on Amazon sales transactions, including order details, dates, fulfillment methods, product categories, quantities sold, sales amounts, and shipping information.

## Key Objectives:
1. Sales Overview: Understand the overall sales performance, trends, and patterns over time.
2. Product Analysis: Analyze the distribution of product categories, sizes, and quantities sold to identify popular products.
3. Fulfillment Analysis: Investigate the fulfillment methods used and their effectiveness in delivering orders.
4. Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their buying behaviour, location, and other relevant factors.
5. Geographical Analysis: Explore the geographical distribution of sales, focusing on states and cities.
6. Business Insights: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to optimize sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (Databricks SQL)
- Tableau
- Google Colab

   Raw data storage, cleaned datasets, and Python notebook for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.

2. **SQL Analysis**  
   SQL queries written in Databricks SQL to answer key business questions and extract actionable insights.

3. **Python Analysis**  
   Exploratory analysis and visualization to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.

4. **Dashboard**  
   Interactive Tableau dashboard summarizing key findings. Dashboard screenshots and files are linked in the Dashboard folder.

5. **Report**  
   Final PDF report summarizing analysis, insights, and business recommendations.

## Key Insights
- B2C customers drive the majority of orders and revenue, while B2B customers show higher AOV and lower cancellation rates, indicating strong growth potential.

- Sales exhibit a clear seasonal spike in April, suggesting promotion- or demand-driven behavior.

- Revenue is geographically concentrated, with the top five states contributing over half of total sales.

- Order cancellations are a major revenue leakage, especially in merchant-fulfilled orders and select remote regions.

- Amazon-fulfilled orders perform more reliably, with higher delivery success and lower cancellations.

- Apparel products, particularly T-shirts and Shirts, along with sizes M, L, and XL, generate most of the revenue.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from raw data processing to insight generation and visualization, using industry-standard tools and best practices.
- Business performance is volume-driven by B2C, but profitability and stability can be improved by scaling B2B.
- Addressing fulfilment inefficiencies and high-cancellation regions can significantly improve net revenue.
- Focusing inventory and marketing on high-performing products and sizes improves operational efficiency.
- Geographical diversification is essential to reduce dependency risk and enable sustainable growth.
- The integrated use of Python, SQL, and Tableau dashboards enables end-to-end, data-driven decision-making.
